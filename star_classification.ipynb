    "In astronomy, the classification scheme of galaxies, quasars and stars is fundamendamental, as early cataloguing of stars and their distribution in the sky has led to the understanding that they make up our own galaxy and, following the distinction that Andromeda was a separate galaxy to our own, numerous galaxies began to be surveyed as more powerful telescopes were built. This datasat aims to classificate stars, galaxies, and quasars based on their spectral characteristics."

    "\n",
    "- **Galaxy**\n",
    "    - A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems, all held together by gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Star**\n",
    "    - any object that is sufficiently massive that it can ignite the fusion of elements in its core due to the gravitational pressures inside the object itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quasar**\n",
    "    - Quasar is short for quasi-stellar radio source, because astronomers first discovered quasars in 1963 as objects that looked like stars but emitted radio waves. Now, the term is a catch-all for all feeding, and therefore luminous supermassive black holes, also often called active galactic nuclei. But quasars are a different breed of black hole. They reside in galaxies with plentiful gas supplies, perhaps supplied by a recent galaxy-galaxy collision, and they gorge on the inflowing material. The gas spirals around as it falls in, heating up in the process and emitting radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum."
